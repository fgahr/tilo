A very simple time logging system written in Golang.

This is mainly meant as a personal learning project and is very much incomplete.
That being said, I intend to use it and fix/improve it as necessary.

As of now, the code is not nearly as elegant as it could/should be. I hope to
remedy that at some point.

I do have a few features in mind that I might add in the future. Among those is
a list of planned features in the README as well as actual documentation other
than the source code.
